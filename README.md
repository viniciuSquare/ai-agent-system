# AI | Self-Hosted Agentic System Project

> 🎯 **Building an intelligent personal assistant ecosystem** that transforms how you interact with your knowledge, tasks, and projects through specialized AI agents.

## 🌟 Project Vision

Create a comprehensive **self-hosted AI agent system** that serves as your digital cognitive extension:

1. **Personal Knowledge Base** - Consume, maintain, and intelligently access notes, documentation, projects, and tasks
2. **Specialized Agent Team** - Coordinated AI agents working together:
   - **Project Manager Agent** - Requirements analyzer for feature sketches
   - **Code Analyst Agent** - Change analyzer for reviewing diffs and recent changes  
   - **Refiner Agent** - Synthesizes feedback and coordinates improvements
3. **Context-Aware Intelligence** - Switch seamlessly between different life domains (work, personal, learning)
