## Effort Distribution by Phase

| Phase | Total Issues | Total Effort Points | Estimated Weeks |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Phase 1 | Not tracked in issues | TBD | TBD |
| Phase 2 | 9 issues | 67 points | 13-17 weeks |
| Phase 3 | 8 issues | 61 points | 12-15 weeks |
| Phase 4 | 8 issues | 102 points | 20-25 weeks |
| Phase 5 | 6 issues | 54+ points | 10-13 weeks |
| **Total** | **31+ issues** | **284+ points** | **55-70+ weeks** |

## Critical Path Analysis

### Immediate Blockers
1. **Phase 1 Foundation** - Must be completed before any agent development
2. **#3: Input Schema Definition** - Blocks multiple Phase 2 tasks
3. **#21: Agent Message Schema** - Foundation for multi-agent system

### High-Risk Dependencies
1. **#9: n8n Workflow Orchestration (XL-13)** - Complex integration point
2. **#17: Impact Analysis Logic (XL-13)** - Core analytical capability
3. **#25: Synthesis Workflow Implementation (XL-15)** - Most complex single task
4. **#28: End-to-End Integration Tests (XL-16)** - Final validation step

### Parallel Development Opportunities
- **Phase 2**: #6 (Prompt Engineering) can be developed in parallel with #3-#5
- **Phase 3**: #12, #13, #14 (foundational utilities) can be developed in parallel
- **Phase 4**: #21, #22 (foundation components) can be developed in parallel
- **Phase 5**: Most optimization tasks can be developed in parallel

## Development Recommendations

### Short-term Focus (Next 4-8 weeks)
1. Complete Phase 1 foundation work (not tracked in current issues)
2. Begin Phase 2 with #3 (Input Schema Definition)
3. Start parallel work on #6 (Prompt Engineering)

### Medium-term Planning (2-4 months)
1. Complete Phase 2 Requirements Analyzer
2. Begin Phase 3 Change Analyzer foundational work
3. Prepare Phase 4 architecture planning

### Long-term Strategy (6+ months)
1. Complete multi-agent integration (Phase 4)
2. Begin optimization and advanced features (Phase 5)
3. Continuous testing and refinement

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **N8N Complexity**: Plan for extended development time on workflow tasks
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Invest heavily in message schema and testing
- **Performance Requirements**: Start optimization early in Phase 5

### Dependency Risks
- **Phase 1 Delays**: Could cascade through entire project timeline
- **External Dependencies**: Monitor Ollama, Qdrant, and N8N compatibility
- **Resource Constraints**: Consider breaking down XL tasks into smaller chunks
